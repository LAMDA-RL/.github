# LAMDA-RL Group
We are a fork of researchers from [LAMDA Group @ Nanjing University](https://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/MainPage.ashx), led by Professor [Yang Yu](https://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/yuy) and [Zong-Zhang Zhang](https://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/zhangzz). We are dedicated to scientific research in reinforcement learning. Our research is devoted to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), Representation Learning (RepL) and Transfer Learning in RL. 

This organization repo open-sources the codes of our latest papers as well as useful tool-kits for RL algorithm designing.
